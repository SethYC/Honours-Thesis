# Honour's Thesis: DTD Functional Connectivity

The scripts were used to process and analyze the fMRI data of a Developmental Topographic Disorientation (DTD) group and a control group, outputting connectivity measures to be statistically compared later. See my thesis (can be requested) for a detailed description of its use.

`Analysis.py` is the first script to be run, followed by `pickle reader.py`. The file directories hardcoded inside need to be changed to run on your own machine.
