# Honour-s-Thesis-DTD-Functional-Connectivity
A repository for the scripts I created for my honour's thesis in psychology. The scripts were used to process and analyze the fMRI data of a Developmental Topographic Disorientation (DTD) group and a control group, outputting connectivity measures to be statistically compared later.
